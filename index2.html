    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>The Beatles were an English rock band, started in Liverpool, England in 1960. They were, and still are, one of the most successful and influential bands in the history of modern music. The Beatles drew influences from many music genres through their career, including 1950s rock and roll, rhythm and blues, classical, psychedelia, and Indian music, and their songs ranged from pop ballads to hard rock.

        The members of the band were John Lennon (rhythm guitar), Paul McCartney (bass guitar), George Harrison (lead guitar) and Ringo Starr (drums).
        
        Brian Epstein was their manager. George Martin produced all of their albums and singles except for the album "Let It Be", which was produced by the famous 1960s producer Phil Spector. Almost all of their music was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London.</p>
